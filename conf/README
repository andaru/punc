Configuration files for punc have the basic theme that they
lay out recipes of configuration collections. These recipes
define devices that will have an action rule set, defined in code,
executed against the device.  Results of these activities are
parsed, and written to user defined paths.

This allows one to produce a output directories much like the
RANCID output, as can be seen in the file punc.yaml.standard,
or output where different recipes in a collection go to
the same directory (which is the default behaviour).
