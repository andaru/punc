PUNC: Pick Up (Your) Network Configuration
==========================================

PUNC is a network element configuration backup tool in the same vein
as RANCID.  It differs in so much as the reasons it was built, namely;

 * Flexible command execution strategies (during runtime)
 * Distribution of device connections via usage of the Notch service.
 * Scaling to large numbers of devices, in complex network architectures.

PUNC is just one network automation application that can be built
using Notch, a Network Operator's Toolkit for Command-line Hacking.
